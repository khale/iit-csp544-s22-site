## Course Overview

We increasingly live in a digitally-connected world. More of our personal
systems, national infrastructures, automobiles, and smart devices are becoming
internet-connected, so the importance of secure systems is more critical than
ever. Unfortunately, tracking the trend for internet-connected systems is an
increasing prevalence of malicious actors and criminals intent on breaking,
subverting, and otherwise sabotaging important systems. Billions of dollars are
lost and thousands of lives are affected by such cybercrime, and there is
a dearth of trained talent to offset these trends. We must endeavor to train
ethical hackers with strong cyber-security techniques, who understand the
toolkits and trades employed by cybercriminals, and imbue them with an ethos of
using their knowledge for good. This course will be a programming-based,
learn-by-doing-oriented course focused on applying foundational principles in
security to real systems and networks . You will implement several real attacks
and take advantage of several recreated vulnerable systems in order to
understand the modern landscape of network and systems security. Other than
implementing our own attacks, we will also be looking at various case studies
of attacks and defense strategies, including known exploit proofs-of-concept,
published papers, and documents from security agencies and cyber-security
research firms.

## Prerequisites
1. CS458 (Information Security)
2. A reasonably strong CS background in security or networking/systems
3. We assume that students are familiar with some programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, or Python.

Exceptions to the above can be made, just come talk to us.

## Course Goals

- Explore a range of existing problems and tensions in modern system and network security
- Gain a deep understanding of issues, concepts, threats, operational challenges as well as solutions in securing systems and networks
- Learn real-world security principles through hands-on practice and tools to assess, defend, and investigate systems and networks

## Details
The course is organized into multiple cycles and each cycle will focus on one
topic in system and network security from theory to practice. We will first
study the theory behind various attack vectors as well as countermeasures, and
then gain deep insights through hands-on construction and experimentation with
real-world implementations. Ideally, we will participate in a capture-the-flag
competition at the end of the course. Topics include but are not limited to
malware design (e.g., rootkit), web security (e.g., sql injection attacks,
cross-site scripting attacks), OS and software security (e.g., shared library,
reverse engineering, buffer overflow attacks, vulnerability scanning), network
security (e.g., packet sniffing and spoofing, firewalls, protocol-specific
attacks) and cryptography.

- Software Security (8 hours)
- Web Security (6 hours)
- Network Security (11 hours)
- Crypto (4 hours)
- System Security (11 hours)

## Required Textbook
[Computer and Internet Security](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1733003932/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_BRJfEb9D10NPV) by Wenliang Du

## Readings For many lectures, we will be posting required readings on the
course webpage, from various sources. Be sure to read them! If a reading is
marked as required, the reading content is fair game for exams. Any readings
I post that are required will be freely available either from the web or from
me.

## Projects

By far the most important part of this course is the labs. You will learn by
doing. Thus, they will comprise the lion's share of your grade. Unless
otherwise noted you will be working individually on projects. You will be
graded on your lab reports that you submit when you are finished.

### Submitting Work
Unless otherwise noted, you will be submitting lab reports when your lab work
is done. You will submit them on Blackboard by the due date listed on the
course webpage.

### Late Work
For all projects, you can submit up to two days late with penalties. Each day
you will be docked 10%. So if I have a perfect project, submitting two days
late will give me 80%. After two days, submissions will not be accepted, and
you will receive a zero.

If you have an emergency or are ill, it may be possible to excuse you from
a project or to get you an extension, but contact me (or have a friend or
family member contact me) as soon as you can. Please don't wait until you get
well / get back into town / start worrying about your Final Grade. Overly
delayed requests may be denied. Requests made after classes end will be denied.

### Regrades
If you think a test or project has been misgraded, then if the TA graded it,
discuss it with the TA first. If you still think it's been misgraded, discuss
it with me. Regrade requests must be specific: Don't just ask us to regrade an
entire problem or assignment. Also, you must include your justification for
a higher grade: Don't just say you think you deserve more points. Regrade
requests should be timely, else they may be denied. In particular, regrade
requests made after classes end will be denied.

## Exams
There will be only a final, comprehensive exam during the last week of classes (not during finals week). There will be no midterm.

### One Page of Notes
For the final exam, you can bring one 8.5" x 11" or A4 page of notes (both
sides; doesn't matter if it's hand-written or printed, etc.) No other notes, no
sharing notes, no books; no phones, no calculators or other aids or devices.

### Makeup Exams
If you can't make it to an exam because you're sick or have an emergency, it
may be possible to get you a makeup exam, but contact me (or have a friend or
family member contact the instructor) as soon as you can. Overly delayed
requests may be denied, so don't wait until you get well / get back into town
/ start worrying about your Final Grade. Requests made after classes end will
be denied (so be on top of things, since the only exam for this course is
during the final week!)

Make-up exams are not a guaranteed right, especially if you ask after the exam.
Barring some urgent reason, you must take tests at the scheduled time (Getting
a cheaper airline ticket is not considered to be an urgent reason).

### No Re-taking Exams
If during the test, you feel too ill to finish it, stop and come up and talk to
me so we can work on rescheduling it — don't turn in the test and then come to
me later. Similarly, don't turn in the Final if you want a grade of Incomplete.


## End-of-Semester Score
The grade break-down for the semester is as follows:

- 70%: Labs and reports
- 20%: Participation
- 10%: Final Exam

All values are scaled to 100 before taking the final sum. 

For internet and India sessions, the grade break-down is:

- 80%: Labs and reports
- 20%: Final Exam


## Letter Grade Cutoffs
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- E: 0-59


## Academic Integrity

You are allowed to discuss your work with others in the class, but ultimately
what you submit must be solely yours. Cheating, plagiarism, copying from other
students, or any other sort of academic dishonesty may result in you getting
a zero on the assignment, may impact your grade negatively, and may result in
refurral to the Dean. 

Please see IIT's code of Academic Honesty [here](https://www.iit.edu/student-affairs/student-handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty).

## Disability Accommodations
Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented
disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter
of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for
Disability Resources (CDR) is located in Life Sciences Room 218, telephone (312) 567-5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

## Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information
Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender
discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among
students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member
or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious.
Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual
misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on
support options and the resolution process.

You can report sexual harassment electronically
[here](https://iit.edu/incidentreport), which may be completed anonymously. You
may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster
at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at
(773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s
Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550
