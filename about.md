## Course Overview

This course introduces undergraduates in their first or second year to CS
research going on in the department, and CS research in general. We will cover
several topics including the CS research process, graduate school, careers in
research, and so on. Most class sessions will be dedicated to introducing
students to the research conducted by a particular faculty member's research
group. 

## Course Outcomes

- Understand why you should pursue research and an honors thesis
- Understand research areas within CS
- Understand topics researched by faculty in the CS department at IIT
- Have a high-level view of the research process
- Gain a basic understanding of how to conduct a literature review
- Gain a basic understanding of how to read a research paper
- Be introduced to several research-related career paths 
- Get an idea of how the graduate school application process works
- Get an idea of how research in graduate school works

## Lectures
There will be a few (short) lectures in this course given by me, but most of
our time will be spent listenting to guest lecturers, usually faculty in the CS
department talking about their own current research efforts. It is critical
that you attend class sessions. 

## Textbooks
There is no required textbook for this course, but see the recommended reading on the main page. 

## Grading

This is a pass/fail course. 
Your grade will be computed according to these criteria:
- 25% Attendance
- 25% Participation
- 50% Assignments

## Assignments

There will be two assignments for the course. Both will be 2-page papers. I will make announcements about their due dates when appropriate. 

### Late work policy
Each day an assignment is late, it will incur a 10% penalty. If an assignment is more than 5 days late, it will not be accepted, and you will receive a zero.

## Exams
There will be no exams for this course.

## Academic Integrity

You are allowed to discuss your work with others in the class, but ultimately
what you submit must be solely yours. Cheating, plagiarism, copying from other
students, or any other sort of academic dishonesty may result in you getting
a zero on the assignment, may impact your grade negatively, and may result in
refurral to the Dean. 

Please see IIT's code of Academic Honesty [here](https://www.iit.edu/student-affairs/student-handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty).

## Disability Accommodations
Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented
disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter
of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for
Disability Resources (CDR) is located in Life Sciences Room 218, telephone (312) 567-5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

## Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information
Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender
discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among
students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member
or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious.
Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual
misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on
support options and the resolution process.

You can report sexual harassment electronically

may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster
at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at eespeland@iit.edu.
