## Welcome!

This is the webpage for CSP 544: System and Network Security at 
[IIT](https://iit.edu).  This course is for undergraduates in Computer Science
who have enrolled in the [Computer Science Honors Research
Specialization](http://bulletin.iit.edu/undergraduate/colleges/computing/computer-science/bs/#specializationstext).
Briefly, the goal of this course is to introduce undergraduates in their first
or second years to the research process and to research going on in our
[department](https://www.iit.edu/computer-science). See more in the
[syllabus](syllabus.md).
