# Lab 3: Buffer Overflows

**Due Date: Monday 1/31/22 before class**

## Lab Overview

For this lab, you will use what you learned in the shellcode lab to implement exploits. 
You can find the SEED lab description [here](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Buffer_Overflow_Server/Buffer_Overflow_Server.pdf). If you've
never used containers before, you may want to see the container manual [here](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/blob/master/manuals/docker/SEEDManual-Container.md). The
lab setup files to be used within the VM can be found [here](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Buffer_Overflow_Server/Labsetup.zip).

You will be implementing attacks L1 through L3. L4 is optional. You can use the following numbers for the `Makefile` variables:
- `L1`: 237
- `L2`: 124
- `L3`: 300
