# Software Security Labs
{: .no_toc .mb-2 }

These are the labs on software security. Software security focuses on the security of applications at all levels of the stack. Here
we focus on security of user-level programs to distinguish from the system security labs we'll study later. We'll be looking at how 
bugs and properties of programs' execution environments and usage of certain system features create vulnerabilities that can be
exploited.
