# Applied Security Labs
{:no_toc}

In this course you will learn about security by implementing your own attacks,
exploits, defenses, and proofs-of-concept. We believe this is the best way to
learn with low-level systems. Many of the labs here are developed by your book
author, [Wenliang Du](https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~wedu/). However, we've added
some of our own fun labs as well. Some labs will be optional, but if you want
to get the best out of the course we strongly encourage that you try them out!
